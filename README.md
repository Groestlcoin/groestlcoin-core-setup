Bitcoin Full Node SetUp

The install-full-node.sh script is based on [bitnodes script](https://bitnodes.io/install-full-node.sh) with some custom changes.

# Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which block chain contains valid transactions. The users of Bitcoin Core only accept transactions 
for that block chain, making it the Bitcoin block chain that everyone else wants to use. For the latest developments related to Bitcoin Core, 
be sure to visit the projectâ€™s [official website](https://bitcoincore.org/).

Also visit [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) for further information.
